/*
    The DialogueActivator is used  to call new pieces of dialogue for Brian.
    It checks when the player or any other object with a specific tag has entered a trigger.
    If so the trigger gets removed so it only happens once and Brian gets new dialogue assigned to him.
    The values are assigned in the inspector on the gameObject.
